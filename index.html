        <p class="pline">Animal crossing new horizons was released in the height of the pandemic in 2020 on nintendo switch. It offered millions of people the chance to escape into an alternate, comforting reality. I was one of those who spent hundreds of hours on the game tending to my island and chatting with my villagers. I will overview what animal crossing is and why it is such a popular game right now.<br><br><br><a href="acnh.html">EXPLORE ANIMAL CROSSING</a></p>

        <p class="pline">Mechanical keyboards are becoming increasingly popular - bouncing back from our world of tactile-less products like touch screen phones and flimsy butterfly keyboards. Mechanical keyboards have a lot that go into them, and it can be daunting to learn about everything that goes into making one (especially because you have to sift through the toxic bro culture so prevalent in this community). I will share a few basics about mechanical keyboards in this section.<br><br><a href="mech.html">EXPLORE KEYBOARDS</a></p>
