        <p class="pline">OVERVIEW<br>There’s a lot that goes into a mechanical keyboard. Each piece that goes into a board affects the look, feel, and sound of the keyboard and typing experience. I will discuss in order of outer to inner layers of a keyboard, with modifications at the end. </p>

        <p class="pline">CASE<br>The keyboard case is the outer shell of the board. It is often made of plastic, but can be composed of other materials like aluminum. Some designers like to take some creative liberties to achieve a unique look like the patina aesthetic on the bottom of this keyboard --></p>

        <p class="pline">KEYCAPS<br>The second layer of the keyboard is the keycaps. These are what you actually type on. Keycaps come in various shapes, colors, and sizes. Sometimes the shape of keycaps can be taller and chunkier, others can be flat and boxy. The shape of a keycap and the material it is made out of is not only for aesthetics, but can contribute to a different sound as well!</p>

        <p class="pline">SWITCHES<br>Underneath keycaps are switches, which you are pushing down as you type. Switches can control the feel and sound of each press, such as a “clicky” switch where you will feel a bump as you press down. Switches are a complex topic and will take too long to explain here!</p>

        <p class="pline">PLATE + PCB<br>Switches are attached to a plate and PCB to stabilize them and connect the switches to the circuit board. Essentially, this allows the keyboard + computer to register any button you press.</p>

        <p class="pline">MODIFICATIONS<br>There are several ways to “mod” your board, like adding lubricant to your switches for a smoother feel, or adding foam in your keyboard to dampen the sound.</p>

        <p class="pline">This is the board I built! It has a specific layout of the keys, which I didn't cover in this page. This layout, Arisu, is a split layout that angles your wrists in a more ergonomic fashion. This keyboard also contains a 5lb solid brass plate which affects the feel and sound of the keyboard.</p>
